# Visual and Aural Telepresence Via NAO Robot #

A 2017-2018 TCNJ senior project in which students attempt to create a remote presence using a NAO Robot with a headset made from a gaming headset and Google Cardboard.  Functionality will include video and audio streaming from the robot to the user, and the user will have to ability to turn their head to control the robot's head as well as speak through the robot.
